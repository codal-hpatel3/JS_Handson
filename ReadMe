# JavaScript Learning Code

This repository contains hands-on JavaScript code examples for learning and practicing core JavaScript concepts.

## Folder Structure

- **JavaScript.js**  
  Entry point with a simple console log.

- **JavaScriptOperators/**  
  - `Operators.js`: Examples of JavaScript operators, including arithmetic and comparison.

- **JavaScriptVariables/**  
  - `Variables.js`: Demonstrates variable declarations using `var`, `let`, and `const`, and explains their scope and redeclaration rules.
  - `DataTypes.js`: Shows primitive data types in JavaScript and how to check their types.
  - `ConstObject.js`: Explains how `const` works with objectsâ€”properties can be changed or added, but the object reference cannot be reassigned.

- **JavaScriptObjects/**  
  - `JavaScriptObjects.js`: Demonstrates how to create and use JavaScript objects, including property access, adding properties, using constructors, and defining methods.

## Topics Covered

- Variable declarations (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Variable scope (block, global)
- Redeclaration and reassignment rules
- Primitive data types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`)
- Operators (arithmetic, equality, strict equality)
- Working with constant objects (`const` with objects)
- Creating and manipulating JavaScript objects
- Object methods and property access

## How to Run

1. Open any `.js` file in your favorite editor (e.g., VS Code).
2. Run the file using Node.js:
   ```sh
   node JavaScriptObjects/JavaScriptObjects.js
   ```
   Replace the path with the file you want to run.
