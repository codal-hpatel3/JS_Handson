## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **JavaScript.js**  
  Entry point with a simple console log.

- **JavaScriptOperators/**
  - `Operators.js`  
    Examples of JavaScript operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and more.

- **JavaScriptVariables/**
  - `Variables.js`  
    Demonstrates variable declarations using `var`, `let`, and `const`, including scope, redeclaration, and reassignment.
  - `DataTypes.js`  
    Shows primitive data types in JavaScript and how to check their types.
  - `ConstObject.js`  
    Explains how `const` works with objects‚Äîproperties can be changed or added, but the object reference cannot be reassigned.

- **JavaScriptObjects/**
  - `JavaScriptObjects.js`  
    Demonstrates how to create and use JavaScript objects, including property access, adding properties, using constructors, defining methods, and iterating over object properties.

- **JavaScriptErrors/**
  - `TryCatchInJavaScript.js`  
    Shows how to handle errors in JavaScript using `try...catch` with clear, easy-to-understand examples.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Code

1. **Open any `.js` file** in your favorite editor (e.g., VS Code).
2. **Run the file using Node.js** in your terminal:
   ```sh
   node path/to/your/file.js
   ```
   For example:
   ```sh
   node JavaScriptObjects/JavaScriptObjects.js
   ```
   Replace the path with the file you want to run.
