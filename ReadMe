# üöÄ JavaScript Learning Code

Welcome to the **JavaScript Learning Code** repository\! üéâ This repo is packed with simple, hands-on examples designed to help you learn JavaScript step by step. Whether you're a beginner or just looking to brush up on core concepts, this collection of code snippets is a perfect companion.

-----

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository is organized by topic, with each folder containing a specific set of examples.

### `JavaScript.js`

A basic file to get started with your first "Hello JavaScript" log.

### `JavaScriptOperators`

  * **`Operators.js`**: Explores fundamental operators including arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison (`==`, `===`), logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`), and assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`).

### `JavaScriptVariables`

  * **`Variables.js`**: Demonstrates the use of `var`, `let`, and `const`, explaining their differences in terms of scope and reassignment rules.
  * **`DataTypes.js`**: Covers the primitive data types in JavaScript: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `bigint`.
  * **`ConstObject.js`**: Illustrates a key concept: `const` objects can have their properties changed, but the object itself cannot be reassigned.

### `JavaScriptObjects`

  * **`JavaScriptObjects.js`**: A comprehensive look at creating objects, accessing and adding properties, using constructors, defining methods, and iterating over properties.

### `JavaScriptArrays`

  * **`Arrays.js`**: Introduces the basics of creating and using arrays.
  * **`ArrayMethods.js`**: Showcases common and powerful array methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

### `JavaScriptErrors`

  * **`TryCatchInJavaScript.js`**: Provides examples of how to handle runtime errors gracefully using the `try...catch` block.

### `JavaScriptAsyncAwait`

  * **`JsAsyncAwait.js`**: A step-by-step guide to understanding asynchronous JavaScript through callbacks, Promises, and the modern `async/await` syntax.

### `JavaScriptClass`

  * **`ClassBasics.js`**: Covers the basic syntax for creating classes.
  * **`Inheritance.js`**: Explains how to extend classes using the `extends` keyword and the `super()` method.
  * **`StaticMethods.js`**: Demonstrates the use of static properties and methods that belong to the class itself, not an instance.

## üìö Core Topics Covered

This repository contains examples covering the following topics:

  * **Variables**: `var`, `let`, `const` and their scope rules.
  * **Data Types**: Understanding primitive types.
  * **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators.
  * **Objects**: Creating, accessing, and iterating over object properties.
  * **Arrays**: Common array methods and manipulation.
  * **Error Handling**: Using `try...catch` for robust code.
  * **Asynchronous JavaScript**: A clear progression from callbacks to Promises and `async/await`.
  * **ES6 Classes**: Basics of classes, inheritance, and static methods.

## üñ•Ô∏è Quick Examples

Here's a taste of what you'll find inside:

**Variables**

```javascript
let name = "Himen";
const age = 25;
var city = "Ahmedabad";
```

**Objects**

```javascript
let user = { name: "Himen", age: 25 };
console.log(user.name); // Himen
```

**Arrays**

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Promise + Async/Await**

```javascript
function greet() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Hello!"), 1000);
  });
}

async function showGreeting() {
  let message = await greet();
  console.log(message);
}

showGreeting(); // "Hello!" after 1s
```

**Class Inheritance**

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

let dog = new Dog("Tommy");
dog.speak(); // Tommy barks.
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Code

To run these examples on your machine, you'll need **Node.js** installed.

1.  If you don't have Node.js, you can download it from the official website.

2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.

3.  Navigate to the folder containing the JavaScript file you want to run.

4.  Execute the file using the `node` command:

    ```sh
    node path/to/file.js
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```sh
    node JavaScriptClass/ClassBasics.js
    ```
